<p>
 I am a senior undergraduate student at Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, India, pursuing a dual degree &mdash; B.Engg. Computer Science and M.Sc. Biology.</p>
 <p>
Currently, I am advised by <a href="http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/rmcichy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Radoslaw Martin Cichy</a> and <a href="http://www.cvai.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Gemma Roig</a> for my thesis.

My primary focus is Computer Vision and Deep Learning, in general, with a tangential interest  in Computational Biology. I want to work towards interpretable representations in generative models for
computer vision and human-inspired AI.
</p> 
<p>
Feel free to reach out for collaborations and discussion!
