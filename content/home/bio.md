title: About Me
---
<p> <!-- style="text-align:justify"> -->
        I have an immense passion for understanding natural and artificial intelligence. Throughout my undergraduate degree, I have
        had chances to collaborate with amazing researchers in the domains of bioinformatics, genetics, formal language, algorithms
        and deep learning. The exploration spree ultimately settled at computer vision and machine learning, where I am interested in
        segmentation, videos and multi-modal analytics, and reconstruction.

        I am currently working at <a href="https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/arbeitsbereiche/neural_dyn_of_vis_cog/index.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Radek Cichy's Lab</a> to decode natural videos from fMRI data. While modelling the brain using neural
        networks, I am also trying to elucidate the learning process in deep neural models. I am also associated with <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/AdvancedDataAnalyticsParallelTechnologiesLaboratory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ADAPT Lab</a> to
        build a novel de-novo genome assembler. We are working on new data-structures, and heuristic algorithms to re-construct the DNA sequence assembly efficiently.

        I have also been a part of healthcare initiatives in computer science especially for <a href="/project/heavy_metal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer</a> and <a href="/project/covid_genome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SARS-CoV-2</a>. Some past collaborators and mentors who helped me shape (and continue to shape) my scientific perspective include
        <a href="http://arunsethuraman.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Arun Sethuraman</a>,
        <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/meghanatare/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Meghana Tare</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rajeshk/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Rajesh Kumar</a>.
