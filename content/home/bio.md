title: About Me
---
<p> <!-- style="text-align:justify"> -->
        I have an immense passion for understanding natural and artificial intelligence. Throughout my undergraduate degree, I have had chances to collaborate with exceptional researchers in the domains of bioinformatics, formal language, data mining and deep learning. The exploration spree ultimately settled at computer vision and machine learning, where I am interested in generative modelling, representation learning and interpretable approaches.

        I am currently working at <a href="http://www.cvai.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVAI Lab</a> and <a href="https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/arbeitsbereiche/neural_dyn_of_vis_cog/index.html"  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition Lab</a> to reconstruct natural videos from fMRI data. I am using a DNN-guided inversion approach to enforce a natural prior constraint by inverting the activation space to get back the videos. In this process, I am exploring the ideas of architectural priors, represenation learning and interpretability of natural and artifical systems.

        I have also been a part of healthcare initiatives in computer science, especially for <a href="/project/heavy_metal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancer</a> and <a href="/project/covid_genome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SARS-CoV-2</a>. Some past collaborators and mentors who helped me shape (and continue to shape) my scientific perspective include
        <a href="http://peterwonka.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Peter Wonka</a>, <a href="http://arunsethuraman.weebly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Arun Sethuraman</a>
        and <a href="https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/meghanatare/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Meghana Tare</a>.
