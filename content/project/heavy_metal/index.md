title: Optimizing Structure Of Novel Heavy Metal Complexes For Cancer Detection
summary: Cancer diagnosis is expensive and not easily available. We performed an in-silico study using molecular docking to optimize the AIE-active in-house developed heavy metal complexes against cancer biomarkers, paving road for wet-lab analysis.

**Status**: Completed (Aug 2020 - Dec 2020)

The Cancer Diagnostic Tool Project is a collaboration between the Department of Biological Sciences and Department fo Chemsitry, BITS Pilani. As a part of the initiative, in-house developed backbones of novel heavy metal complex were being explored to develop affordable (less than 1 USD) and portable cancer diagnostic tools. These heavy metal complexes rely on Aggregation-Induced Emission (AIE) mechanism for detection. My job, under the guidance of [Prof. Shibasish Chowdhury](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/shiba/profile), was to find the optimal structure of the complexes against EphB4 (a cancer biomarker) using molecular docking. The results from my in-silico study are being translated to the wet-lab work to test and further optimise the structure.
