**Status**: Completed (Jul 2020 - Oct 2021)


I worked with [Prof. Peter Wonka](http://peterwonka.net/) at the [Visual Computing Center](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/vcc), KAUST. I worked on improving the PSNR values for neural implicit 
representations for Images. Building on the Random Fourier Features, I experimented with different 
approaches &mdash; neighbourhood-aware representation, hierarchically scaled representation and multi-step
representations (with differential RGB images). With heirarchical scaling, we were able to imrpove the PSNR
values as much as 0.3 for some cases. However, large-scale experiments are required to substantiate the claims.
