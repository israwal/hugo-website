title: Analysis Of Long-Distance Linked Selection In Indian Variants Of SARS-CoV-2
summary: Mutations that thrive in the population confer a survival advantage to the (viral) species. I built the first ever data-driven model to explain the synergistic driving forces in long-distance mutations using association rule mining.

**Status**: Completed (June 2020 - Sept 2020)


This project was done virtually during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, in collaboration with [Prof. Arun Sethuraman](http://arunsethuraman.weebly.com/), California State University, San Marcos. Long-range mutations are not well studied in evolutionary biology. We hypothesised that associations in long-range mutations give more reasons to inspect causality in SARS-CoV-2. This would help to analyse the trajectory of mutations of the virus. We analysed 1,200 whole genome sequences and identified 14 significant non-synonymous mutations. The association rules were mined using the apriori algorithm, and their stability was analysed using homology modelling. This was the first-ever data-driven analysis of long-range viral mutations. We found two clusters of significant non-synonymous mutations and analysed the intra and inter-cluster rules (figure above).
