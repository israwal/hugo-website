title: Computational Modelling Of Gene Regulatory Networks Using Formal Methods
summary: Gene expression is controlled by the concentrations of multiple proteins, which can be modelled as discrete circuit (based on the threshold concentrations). We prove the relationaship between two popular formal stochastic frameworks.

**Status**: Completed (Aug 2020 - Dec 2020)

In collaboration with [Prof. Rajesh Kumar](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rajeshk/profile), Formal Methods Lab, BITS Pilani, we theoretically showed the close ties between the two popular Boolean models of stochasticity- Stochasticity in Nodes ([SIN](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17543998/)) and Stochasticity in Function ([SIF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2687968/)). This was done by proving both the models as a special instance of the generic framework- context sensitive probabilistic Boolean networks which are modelled using discrete time markov chains. We also attempted to understand the stable attractor dynamics of probabiltic networks and their physical implications as different phenotypes.
