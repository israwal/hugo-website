title: Stochastic Modelling Of Gene Regulatory Networks Using cs-PBN
summary: Gene expression in genetic circuits is influenced by the concentrations of multiple proteins, modelled as a discrete circuit (based on the threshold concentrations). I theoretically proved the relationship between two popular formal stochastic frameworks.

**Status**: Completed (Aug 2020 - Dec 2020)

In collaboration with [Prof. Rajesh Kumar](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/rajeshk/profile), Formal Methods Lab, BITS Pilani, I theoretically showed the close ties between the two popular Boolean models of stochasticity &mdash; Stochasticity in Nodes ([SIN](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17543998/)) and Stochasticity in Function ([SIF](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2687968/)). This was done by proving both the models as a special instance of the generic framework of context-sensitive Probabilistic Boolean Networks, modelled using discrete-time Markov chains. We also attempted to understand the stable attractor dynamics of probabilistic networks and their physical implications as different phenotypes.
