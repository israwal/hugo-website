title: Deep Video Reconstruction From Brain Activity
summary: fMRI is nosiy high-dimensional data with poor temporal resolution. We are using deep neural network activation values as a proxy to reconstruct the videos and understand the computation in both- brain and neural networks.

**Status**: Ongoing (Since Dec 2020)

I am working with [Prof. Radoslaw Martin Cichy](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/rmcichy/) ([Neural Dynamics of Visual Cognition Lab](https://www.ewi-psy.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/arbeitsbereiche/neural_dyn_of_vis_cog/index.html), Freie Universit√§t Berlin) and [Prof. Gemma Roig](http://www.cvai.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/team.html) ([Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://www.cvai.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/), Goethe University) to decode and reconstruct the features of natural videos from brain fMRI signals using Deep Learning. We are using deep neural network activations as a proxy to map the fMRI features to the video space to decode, understand and compare the hierarchical and selective representation of features in the brain and neural network. We are also exploring end-to-end models which can produce both encodings and decodings.
