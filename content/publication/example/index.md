abstract: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. As reported, the RNA virus is mutating. The mutations and their effects need to be taken into account when designing the vaccines or other therapeutics. Motivated by this, we analyzed 1,202 full-genome sequences of the virus sequenced in India. We filtered non-synonymous mutations on two levels- first on the basis of the percentage identity, followed by the divergence in the biochemical nature of the mutated amino acids, and identified 15 functional mutations, including the previously characterized D616G that controls structural stability of the spike protein. However, some mutations, like the A994D in the nsp3 protein, cannot be explained due to the lack of knowledge about the protein. These characterized mutations, which are distributed throughout the genome, show a distinct pattern of clustering into two distinct groups- (nsp1-nsp5) group and (n-s) group, separated by a highly conserved region of 10,500 base pairs.<br><br>We hypothesize that selective pressure on the virus can lead to the association of both- intra-cluster and inter-cluster mutations. This is different from the conventional selective sweeps, which is based on the hitchhiking of closely linked genes (in recombining species). Hence, this heterogeneous pattern of mutations cannot be explained by the standard LD and SFS approaches. Here we design and apply a series of long-distance association tests to quantify linked selection along the distant functional mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 genome. These tests could, in principle, provide clues about functional mutations on unknown segments of the genome, the mechanisms of mutation and the evolutionary trajectory of the virus.
